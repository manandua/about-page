            <p class="">
                Born in Mumbai, India, I shifted to Delhi at the age of 4. As long as I can remember, I have always wanted to work in the field of digital arts. Organizing my abstract thoughts and bringing them to life using technology puts me at ease. Itâ€™s clear that the influence of design is expanding within society, and so is the use of technology. I have been able to incorporate motion and graphic design to showcase my creativity.
